# Style Guide

\[[Edit on GDocs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LxoxOoPWMtRPa0S2PDPyUqAyVPfbPJyM)\]

1. Prepare the text in English. The Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition (CMOS) is being used as the overall publication style. We will stay close to (CMOS) but not 100% compliant as we have many non/English native writers and styles vary. Points to note will be:  
   1. We will use International English as the primary audience is English as a second language in Europe as the expectation of the reader leans towards UK English. For example end wods is ise and ize, but use US License as Creative Commons use the US form of license. This also applies to en and em dashes, use spaces unlike the US with no space. Refer to The Economist style guide as that caters to a US EN audience.  
   2. Use the [Oxford Comma](https://cmosshoptalk.com/2020/02/11/oxford-chicago-and-the-serial-comma/). Which means the presence of a comma before and or or in a list of three or more items.  
   3. En and em dash policy. For em dash use we'll keep with CMOS guidelines on em dash used for punctuation em dash with space before and after (USA and CMOS have no space but in Europe it is more common to have space either side. Make sure en dashes are used where needed and not hyphens.  
2. Typesetting punctuation:  
   1. Use no breaking hyphens in phrases like Co‑creation – Word instructions [https://word.tips.net/T001116\_Inserting\_a\_Non-Breaking\_Hyphen.html](https://word.tips.net/T001116_Inserting_a_Non-Breaking_Hyphen.html) – HTML [https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/non-breaking-hyphen/](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/non-breaking-hyphen/)  
3. Capitalisation:  
   1. For terms like open science, open access, open data, or FAIR data, etc. Generally we will aim for lowercase words to keep the reading flow easy, follow this rule for movements, schools. [https://7sage.com/admissions/lesson/capitalization/](https://7sage.com/admissions/lesson/capitalization/) Capitalize the names of movements and schools derived from proper nouns; lowercase those that are not. Unfortunately, there are some exceptions: “Cynic,” “Scholasticism” and “New Criticism,” for example, are capitalized when used as movements. Look a term up in Merriam-Webster if you're not sure. romanticism; Keynesian economics; cubism; Cynicism. The rule of thumb can also be applied that capitalisation is to get rid of ambiguity. So in our example  
   2. FAIR data would have acronym capitalised  
   3. Open science, open data, and open access – would all be lowercase  
   4. Open source software – here we run into the 'rival camps' problem. There is the Free Software Foundation (Richard Stallman) and the Open Source (Eric Raymond) movement who disagree on ideologies. Properly the full term should be use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) but its a mouthful. And there is more to the story. Our get out is to use the precompound adjective open-source.  
   5. I will list more examples as they come up.  
   6. Article titles capitalised as 'title capitalisation', running headers only first word and after :  
   7. Job or role title removed.
