The role is that of content planning and project management – that contributions fulfill the mission to make a compelling and exciting end product; ensuring publication review groups and production workflows stay on track. Duties: maintain content outline; organise meeting schedule; oversee technical production, and; responsible for legal, ethical, and quality guidelines and standards compliance on behalf of CSWG.\nEditorial committee (can also peer review): Chair – Paul Ayris, with a minimum of four members of the committee. The committee is made up of the section editors. There will be one section editor per section of four sections (optionally sometimes two section editors). The committee has the final editorial signoff on content. The role of the committee is content coordination and commissioning contributions – that sections have enough content, the right type of content, and that style guides and templates, etc., are being followed.\nSection editors: The role of the section editor is to oversee that the content fits the scope and editorial policy. Section editors work with close support from the Editors-in-Chief and report to the editorial committee with the content of the section, recruit contributors, and correspond with peer reviewers. Section editors would ensure that contributors have followed contributor guidelines.\nSection editors are:\n\nCitizen Science research infrastructure – Kirsty Wallis, University College London\nGood (Open Science) scholarly practice in Citizen Science – Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, OpenHumans\nGuidelines for Citizen Science programme development in libraries – Paul Ayris, University College London\nCitizen Science Skilling for Staff, Researchers, and the Public – Jitka Stilund Hansen, DTU Library, Technical University of Denmark, ORCID iD: 0000-0002-5888-1221 e-mail: jstha@dtu.dk\n\nContributor: A contributor would provide one or two articles in agreement with section editors following the templates and style sheet of the guide.\nPeer review: Carry out some parts as Open Peer Review. Made up of people appointed by section editors. There will be two peer reviewers per section. The reviews will be selected from – CSWG; editorial committee; external appointees, and publication partners and collaborators.\nScientific peer review: The editorial committee would aim to appoint two experts in the field as external reviewers.\nPartners: Bring on contributing partners to the publication as institutional partners. Primarily these partners would provide and exchange content, as experts in the field, and be co-producers. These partners could also contribute resources and be attributed: DOIs, ISBN, profiling, translations, etc. Letters of agreement would be made with partners.\nCollaborations: These would orientate around content provision, advocacy, research and resource provision.",

The Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition (CMOS) is being used as the overall publication style. We will stay close to (CMOS) but not 100% complaint as we have many non/English native writers and stzles vary. Points to note will be:\n\nWe will use an International English as the primary audience is English as a second language in Europe as the expectation of the reader leans towards UK English. For example end wods is ise and ize, but use US License as Creative Commons use the US form of license. This also applies to en and em dashes, use spaces unlike the US with no space. Refer to The Ecnoomist style guide as that caters to a US EN audience.\nUse the Oxford Comma. Which means the presence of a comma before and or or in a list of three or more items.\n\nEn and em dash policy. For em dash use we’ll keep with CMOS guidlines on em dash used for puntuation em dash with space before and after (USA and CMOS have no space but in Europe it is more common to have space either side. Make sure en dashes are used where needed and not hyphens.\n\nTypesetting punctuation:\n\nUse no breaking hyphens in phrases like Co‑creation – Word instructions https://word.tips.net/T001116_Inserting_a_Non-Breaking_Hyphen.html – HTML https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/non-breaking-hyphen/\n\nCapitalisation:\n\nFor terms like open science, open access, open data, or FAIR data, etc. Generally we will aim for lowercase words to keep the reading flow easy, follow this rule for movements, schools. https://7sage.com/admissions/lesson/capitalization/ Capitalize the names of movements and schools derived from proper nouns; lowercase those that are not. Unfortunately, there are some exceptions: “Cynic,” “Scholasticism” and “New Criticism,” for example, are capitalized when used as movements. Look a term up in Merriam-Webster if you’re not sure. romanticism; Keynesian economics; cubism; Cynicism. The rule of thumb can also be applied that capitalisation is to get rid of ambiguity. So in our example\nFAIR data would have acronym capitalised\n\nOpen science, open data, and open access – would all be lowercase\nOpen source software – here we run into the ‘rival camps’ problem. There is the Free Software Foundation (Richard Stallman) and the Open Source (Eric Raymond) movement who disagree on ideologies. Properly the full term should be use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) but its a mouthful. And there is more to the story. Our get out is to use the precompound adjective open-source.\nI will list more examples as they come up.\nArticle titles capitalised as ‘title capitalisation’, running headers only first word and after :\nJob or role title removed.",

See the Book area of the site to preview content in final outputs such as PDF, eBook, Web, WebBook, etc.\nImages: Images can be configured to appear in text as: figures, photos, to replace tables, etc. Also figures can be set to display captions or not. Last images can be set as 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% width. Image widths can be set later at the time of publishing.\nIntro, author, and DOI styling. See example: https://write.handbuch.io/document/465. Intro uses the Abstract style. Author text as Normal style. DOI line is made as bold.\nAdding or converting manual added citations. Fidus Writer has a citation manager that needs to be used as this applies citation style langauge to citations - styling them and organising them. Place cursor inline where you want the citation to be inserted. In top menu select Cite - you will be able to either search databases for citation or manually add a citation. The citation will be added inline and at bottom of article. Citations get automatically styled if citation style is changed. Citations can be edited by clicking them in the bottom of the article.\nInserting footnotes. Use * tool from format toolbar at top of document.\nTables. Tables can be added and edited from the format toolbar and via the three dot edit icon inline. Note: Currently in the CS Guide publications tables are exclusively used to style the info boxes. See information in the Article finishing section.\nSpelling and grammar check: A spellchecker is available from the Tools menu. Once spelling and grammar checker has been loaded - right click on marked items to see correction suggestions. To remove marks use the menu item: Tools &gt; Spelling and Grammar &gt; Remove items.\nLinks: URL links can be added and edited. Do not use the internal links function as this does not work for all outputs.\nSave revisions: You can make snapshot saved revisions - for example to save a copy prior to editing reviews. These revisions need to be loaded back into the system as new documents which is a bit cumbersome. Contact support to revert to a revision.\nSharing articles: to give others access to documents you need to share the document with a specific user. See the file menu for sharing options.\nTrack changes: There is full track changes functionality if needed. See the top level menu item in documents.",

To make an info box first create a table with only one cell, then paste content into the cell and format as usual. The effect of using the table is that it puts a blue background behind and around the text.\nPlease divide the text into sections, with the following.
