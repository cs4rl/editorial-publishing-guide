      <h2 id="H592737">Foreword</h2>
      <p>Open Science has become an indispensable part of modern science. There are several definitions of "openness" in relation to different aspects of science - the <a href="https://opendefinition.org/" title="https://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a> sets out principles as follows “Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).” <strong>Practical guides</strong> for the implementation of those principles in different areas such as research data or publishing are of great importance because they can be used right away. </p>
      <p>In this compendium, we compile important guides with their specific features and fields of application. The book was written as part of a student seminar at the Hannover University of Applied Sciences and Arts.</p>

      <p><strong>Guide name: </strong><a href="https://onlinepublichealth.gwu.edu/resources/equity-vs-equality/" title="https://onlinepublichealth.gwu.edu/resources/equity-vs-equality/">Equity vs. Equality: What's the Difference? </a><span class="citation">(MPH@GW, the George Washington University 2020)</span> </p>
      <p><strong>Target group:</strong> public health masters students, health community, policy and system designers.</p>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Guide for Masters course.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The guide is an introduction to the difference between equality and equity. Firstly it explains the difference in terms of how society hands out resources and opportunities using the USA 1960 example <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Tree" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Tree">The Giving Tree</a></em> is an American children's picture book written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. The core idea being that society is not a natural system and has inbuilt rewards that prioritize social groups.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Equity is a solution for addressing imbalanced social systems. Justice can take equity one step further by fixing the systems in a way that leads to long-term, sustainable, equitable access for generations to come.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The guide then shows example recommendations from leading health institutions and how thes define the topic: for example here with The World Health Organization (WHO) and how <a href="https://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/equity/en/" title="https://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/equity/en/">equity is defined</a>; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) refers to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/strategies2016/index.html" title="https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/strategies2016/index.html">health equity</a>; and here as the <a href="http://viablefuturescenter.org/racemattersinstitute/" title="http://viablefuturescenter.org/racemattersinstitute/">Race Matters Institute</a> desribes.</p>
      <p>The guide then shows examples of how equality and equity differ in policy, for example: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Equality - A city cuts the budget for 25 community centers by reducing the operational hours for all centers by the same amount at the same times. <br>Equity - The city determines which times and how many hours communities actually need to use their community centers and reduces hours for centers that aren't used as frequently.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Short case studies of programs are described and given a list of additional resources.</p>

      <p><strong>Target group:</strong> The target audience of this book are people who want to research basic information and the possibilities of Open Science. Furthermore, Open Science should be accessible to everyone and everyone should have equal rights.</p>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Recommendations for Practice, LIS study.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In Knowledge Justice, scholars from various ethnic backgrounds draw on critical race theory to challenge the fundamental principles, values ​​and assumptions of library and information science in the United States. This is intended to lead the profession to understand how "white" supremacy affects practices, services, curricula, spaces, and policies.</p>
      <p>The authors describe that a misconception of the neutrality and objectivity of library and information science comes from the influence of the different ethnicities of scholars. Through in-depth analyzes of library and archival collections, scholarly communication, power hierarchies, epistemic domination, children's libraries, teaching and learning, digital humanities, and the education system, Knowledge Justice calls for the abolition of so-called "white supremacy" in order to create racial justice for every group of people.</p>

      <p><strong>Target group: </strong>The guide is for authors of all backgrounds, fields, and disciplines, from the sciences to the humanities.</p>
      <p><strong>Type of guide: </strong>This guide is the product of extensive interviews with authors, publishers, and institutional representatives who shared their perspectives on open access options in today’s publishing environment. The information, strategies, and examples included in this guide reflect the collective wisdom of these interviewees.</p>
      <p>The basic structure of this step-by-step guide traces the process of how an author would decide whether and how to make a work openly accessible. Therefore, this design is intended to help with each step of the decision-making-process when thinking about Open Access Publishing. </p>
      <p><strong>Summary: </strong>This Guide provides a scholarly author-oriented look at the ins and outs of open access publishing. It addresses common concerns about what "open access" means, how institutional open access requirements work, and why authors might consider making their work openly accessible online. Furthermore, it provides the reader with real-life strategies and tools that can be used to work with publishers, institutions and funders.</p>
      <p>Following the Introduction, there are three more sections at hand: Section II addresses the trade-off of whether to make the work openly accessible or not. Section III then explains how to do so by giving advices on how "open" to make the work, where to make it openly availabe to the public and also how to secure the right to use third-party content in the later openly accessible work. Also included are strategies on how to make the work openly accessible while also publishing it through a conventional publisher. Finally, the guide concludes with Section IV, a window on the future of open access.</p>

      <p><strong>Target group: </strong>This guide is for universities that want to publish their publications both as Open Access and printed books.</p>
      <p><strong>Type of guide: </strong>This is a book presenting a workflow for producing and publishing academic books in digital form on Open Access and as a printed book.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary: </strong>The immediate, transparent and sustainable dissemination of verifiable scientific results is one of the essential requirements for scientific communication and infrastructure. Open Access, i.e. the open and free use of scientific literature, is the basic prerequisite for this. Colleges and universities are usually the institutions where scientists generate new research results and prepare them for publication in book form. In addition to traditional academic publishers, more and more university presses are therefore publishing academic publications. In the present manual a sustainable and ideal workflow for producing and publishing academic books is presented. That workflow enables universities to publish their publications both as Open Access and printed books in a state-of-theart way and without any restrictions regarding the license, the variety of formats, print run etc. This workflow model will be demonstrated as a proof of concept using selected case studies and reflects the current state of technical and economic technical and economic possibilities in the publishing sector. On the basis of the case studies, the time, costs and personnel involved were also recorded, so that other higher education institutions and universities can be given pointers for the necessary investments in founding and operating their own OA university publishing houses are provided.</p>

A Guide for Citizen Science Practitioners</i> 2016)</span></p>
      <p><strong>Target Group: </strong>This guide is primarily intended for those initiating citizen science projects, but also for anyone participating in such projects.</p>
      <p><strong>Type: </strong>Guide with practical instructions.</p>
      <p><strong>Parts</strong>: Part 1: The Practice of Citizen Science describes the Practice of Citizen Science in Germany. Part 2: The Landscape of Citizen Science presents the possible uses of this participatory approach in various research disciplines and fields.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary: </strong>This guide describes how Citizen Science is practiced in Germany and how this participatory approach can be used in different research disciplines and thematic areas - such as education, nature protection or the humanities. The guide is addressed primarily to initiators of Citizen Science projects, but also to all those who participate in such projects. This includes scientists working in research institutions who want to work with citizens, but also individuals and community groups such as independent scientific groups and associations. This guide is the result of intensive collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders in the citizen science community in the Citizens Create Knowledge Project (BürGEr schaffen WISSen, GEWISS). It is based on insights gained at dialogue forums and other events. Some stories about the projects were received from workshop participants at the Citizen Science Forum in March 2016.</p>
      <p><em>Citizens Create Knowledge – Knowledge Creates Citizens (BürGEr schaffen WISSen – Wissen schafft Bürger, GEWISS) is a capacity-building programme aimed at strengthening citizen science in Germany.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Target Group: </strong>people who are considering whether a citizen science approach can contribute to their work.</p>
      <p><strong>Type: </strong>Decision-framwork scheme for selecting and using citizen science. This guide does not cover the practical details of developing a citizen science project.</p>
      <p><strong>Parts: </strong>This guide should help people to discover: 1. whether citizen science is suitable for your proposed project, and; 2. what type of citizen science is most appropriate for you to adopt. Decision framework will help people to more clearly understand the potential opportunities and limitations of citizen science.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Citizen science can be a very useful "tool" for research and monitoring. There are many different ways to involve volunteers in real science activities. This variety can be very larg for those trying to organize citizen science activities, and citizen science will not always be the most appropriate or optimal approach for research or monitoring.Here is a guide to support people considering a citizen science approach, especially (but not necessarily limited to) biodiversity and environmental monitoring in the UK. It will help you decide whether citizen science can be useful, and help you decide which broad citizen science approach is most appropriate for your issue or activity. </p>

      <p><strong>Target Group: </strong>People who have been involved in Citizen Science and people who are new to this field of science within the UK.</p>
      <p><strong>Type: </strong>Guide for a specific Citizen Science domain of application, written by scientists at the Biological Records Centre und he natural History Museum Angela Marmint Centre for UK Biodiversity, on behalf of the UK Environmental Observtion Framework.</p>
      <p><strong>Parts: </strong>The guide helps citizen who are interested in starting a project (or have already been involved in Citizen Science) step-by-step through the whole process, giving tips and examples of Citizen Science projects.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Much of the UK's understanding of its flora and fauna today is based on the engagement of natural scientists. Citizen Science initiatives to collect environmental data range from crowd-sourcing activities to small groups of volunteer experts collecting and analysing environmental data and sharing their findings with others. Given the different methods of collecting data, it is important that they are well planned and executed. This will not only help science, but also promote environmental awareness among citizens.</p>
      <p>This Guide explains the different approaches to Citizen Science, the first steps to building a team, defining goals, funding the project and finding participants. It guides through the different phases of such a project: the development phase, the live phase and the phase of analysing the data, interpreting it and reporting the results.</p>
      <p>It is based on information collected and analysed as part of the UK-EOF funded project "Understanding Citizen Science &amp; Environmental Monitoring".</p>
